Let's make stuff do things!


So, I have read through and understand what's going on in the simpleGUI class you sent me.
I have tried it and it works on my computer. The only question I have is where is the SimpleGUI method called?
Is that called automatically because it matches the name of the file, if so, is that run first or main?
